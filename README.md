# PCLSerialPrinter

This is a very simple QT5 based application that will receive a PCL printed raster image over a serial port and display it.

It is tested and working on Windows & Linux (using a Marconi 2945 to print) but currently at speeds above 2400baud corruption is occurring which suggests something is wrong with the handshaking.
